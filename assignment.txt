Day 2 ‚Äì SQL Intermediate & API Automation with Postman
Objective: Learn joins, grouping, subqueries, and API automation.

Morning (SQL Intermediate ‚Äì 3 hrs)
Topics: JOINs, GROUP BY, HAVING, subqueries. - Hands-on: Queries on Orders, Customers, Products.

Afternoon (SQL Challenges ‚Äì 2 hrs)
Solve 10 intermediate SQL problems.

Evening (API Automation ‚Äì 3 hrs)
Postman tests: Assertions on response body & status codes. - Organize APIs in Postman Collection. - Run collection with Newman CLI, export HTML report.
Deliverable: SQL queries + Postman collection.


Day 3 ‚Äì SQL Advanced & Code-based API Automation
Objective: Work with advanced SQL queries and create a basic API automation framework.
Morning (SQL Advanced ‚Äì 3 hrs)
Topics: Views, Indexes, Transactions, Constraints, Window Functions. - Hands-on: Advanced queries.

Afternoon (SQL Challenge ‚Äì 2 hrs)
Solve advanced SQL problems.

Evening (API Automation Framework ‚Äì 3 hrs) - Choose:
Java + RestAssured + TestNG OR Python + Requests/Pytest. - Automate one GET and one POST API. - Run tests from IDE/CLI.
Deliverable: Advanced SQL scripts + basic API automation framework.


Day 4 ‚Äì Advanced API Automation (Optional) Objective:
Handle real-world API automation scenarios.

Evening (Chaining Requests ‚Äì 3 hrs)
Capture response values to reuse in subsequent requests.

Deliverable: API automation scripts with auth + data-driven tests.


Day 5 ‚Äì API Automation Best Practices & CI/CD (Optional) Objective: Learn framework structuring, reporting, and CI/CD integration.

Morning (Framework Enhancements ‚Äì 3 hrs)
Organize test cases into modules. - Add logging & reporting.

Afternoon (CI/CD Basics ‚Äì 2 hrs)
Push project to GitHub. - Setup CI/CD pipeline. - Run API tests automatically on commit.

Evening (Final Review & Best Practices ‚Äì 3 hrs)
Review SQL (Day 1‚Äì3).
Review API automation (Day 3‚Äì5).
Discuss best practices for scalable automation.
Deliverable: CI/CD pipeline with automated API tests + reports.


Expected Outcomes - Confident with SQL (basic ‚Üí advanced) queries. - Test APIs manually using Postman. - Automate APIs using Postman. - Build a code-based API automation framework. - (Optional) Handle auth, data-driven tests, and CI/CD.
